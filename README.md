## Why UnSupervised Test Platform ?

The virtual world is becoming a huge barrier for students to take their examinations. This problem is presently faced by all the educational institutions and students around the world. People face a lot of issues to completely virtualize this process, automatic invigilation even though simple is not well implemented anywhere, so if we solve this problem, it would be super useful for educational institutions education.

## Features of this application

❖ Monitor the candidate - Monitors the candidate on camera using OpenCV.js and validates for plagiarism.
❖ Restrict UI Interaction - Warn candidate on the attempt of plagiarism with camera appearance and restrict user interface interaction other than the test console.
❖ Disable Right-click/Copy - Disable the candidate to perform right-click or copy operation on the test console.
❖ Candidate Face Authentication - Using face recognition, the application authenticates the candidate and would allow only a valid candidate to take the test.
❖ Test Report - A test report is generated, once the candidate completes the test. And the candidate can view the report, which will be available under the reports section.
❖ Leaderboard - The candidate can find his score, position and the time taken to finish the test in the leaderboard once he completes the test.
❖ Warning - When the candidate does any mal practise, a warning appears and when the warning count reaches the threshold, the test will be terminated.

## Outcomes

❖ Students are strictly monitored during their examinations. Any kind of malpractice would automatically log them out of website and would report the problem to the university.
❖ The application would make them feel easier and secure, it would completely control the system.
❖ The website would ensure necessary authentication, control, fraud detection and compliance.
❖ This software is a package of remote-supervision, webcam and invigilation control.
❖ The website will have the required profiles and would act according to the institution instructions to conduct the examination.
